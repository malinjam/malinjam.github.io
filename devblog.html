        To brain storm ideas we elected to first let everyone research ideas they were interested in and then combining them using a mind map (below).
        We settled on a thriller inspired pixel game where the character that you interact them most with is not your ally.
        Once we decided on the fundamentals we made a pitch presentation to show our plan for the project.
        As a part of our pitch I made some concept art (can be seen in the presentation).

        To continue our project, we decided on the fundamentals we selected specific functionality we wanted by the Friday demo.
        As we had outlined our plan we knew what functionality would be appropriate to add, so we outlined and implemented the functions below.
        I focused on the creation of object sprites.
        These were:
        <ul class="bullet-points">
          <li> 12 static object sprites</li>
          <li> movement of the camera </li>
          <li> movement of the character </li>
          <li> basic interaction with objects</li>
        </ul>

        After the demo we met up for a supervision session that guided us towards a more concise demo idear.
        Following this we elected to focus on the midpoint of the story.
        As the focus of the satus update was largely business case related we elected to focus more on that this week.
        We together discussed our target group, possible competitors, price of the game and more. 
        We also together designed the laeyr layout and all of the small puzzles within the larger puzzle.
        I also focused on creating the majority of the sprites necessary for the demo.
        All the functions we implemented this week were
        <ul class="bullet-points">
          <li> 2 more audios</li>
          <li> 12 more sprites and tiles </li>
          <li> more dialogue </li>
          <li> the throwing ability for the character </li>
          <li> a flashlight-like lighting implementation</li>
        </ul>
