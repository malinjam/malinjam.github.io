        To brain storm ideas we elected to first let everyone research ideas they were interested in and then combining them using a mind map (below).
        We settled on a thriller inspired pixel game where the character that you interact them most with is not your ally.
        Once we decided on the fundamentals we made a pitch presentation to show our plan for the project.
        As a part of our pitch I made some concept art (can be seen in the presentation).

        To continue our project, we decided on the fundamentals we selected specific functionality we wanted by the Friday demo.
        As we had outlined our plan we knew what functionality would be appropriate to add, so we outlined and implemented the functions below.
        I focused on the creation of object sprites.
        These were:
        <ul class="bullet-points">
          <li> 12 static object sprites</li>
          <li> movement of the camera </li>
          <li> movement of the character </li>
          <li> basic interaction with objects</li>
        </ul>
