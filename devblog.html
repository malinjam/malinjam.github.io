        To brain storm ideas we elected to first let everyone research ideas they were interested in and then combining them using a mind map (below).
        We settled on a thriller inspired pixel game where the character that you interact them most with is not your ally.
        Once we decided on the fundamentals we made a pitch presentation to show our plan for the project.
        As a part of our pitch I made some concept art (can be seen in the presentation).
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IJFkKDANoQyJLzq75-kE9H_XR304pkezXhrW_VStYis/edit?usp=sharing">The presentation can be found here!</a>

        To continue our project, we decided on the fundamentals we selected specific functionality we wanted by the Friday demo.
        As we had outlined our plan we knew what functionality would be appropriate to add, so we outlined and implemented the functions below.
        I focused on the creation of object sprites.
        These were:
        <ul class="bullet-points">
          <li> 12 static object sprites</li>
          <li> movement of the camera </li>
          <li> movement of the character </li>
          <li> basic interaction with objects</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="color-textbox">
        After the demo we met up for a supervision session that guided us towards a more concise demo idear.
        Following this we elected to focus on the midpoint of the story.
        As the focus of the satus update was largely business case related we elected to focus more on that this week.
        We together discussed our target group, possible competitors, price of the game and more. 
        We also together designed the layer layout and all of the small puzzles within the larger puzzle.
        I also focused on creating the majority of the sprites necessary for the demo.
        All the functions we implemented this week were
        <ul class="bullet-points">
          <li> 2 more audios</li>
          <li> 12 more sprites and tiles </li>
          <li> more dialogue </li>
          <li> the throwing ability for the character </li>
          <li> a flashlight-like lighting implementation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

      <div class="color-textbox">
        Following the work from the previous week we continued to implementing sprites.
        Due to the tile size some decisions regarding resizing was done and so I created a large number of new sprites for the new maps, and added them to the tile map.
        Whilst this was happenign the final design for the character was created with animations. I also designed the logo for the game this week. 
        As the second cave is a maze, I designed the first implementation of the maze puzzle this week.
        All the functions we implemented this week were:
        <ul class="bullet-points">
          <li>new maps</li>
          <li>new sprites</li>
          <li>the first version of the maze puzzle</li>
          <li>new character design</li>
          <li>new logo</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="title-project">Game Development course:  Week 5</div>
      <div class="color-textbox">
      This week loads of work was done. The special effects and audio was added onto the scenes. 
      The detail sprites were made so I added them into the existing maps. The throwing and water current mechanics were implemented as well as the pursuing character.
      The dialogue system was set up as well. I also created the base for the website.
      All the functions we implemented this week were
        <ul class="bullet-points">
          <li>sfx audio added</li>
          <li>detail sprites added</li>
          <li>final version of the maps done</li>
          <li>final throwing mechanic implemented</li>
          <li>water current implemented</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="color-textbox">
        This week was the final week before the final presentation, we focused on fixing bugs and final problems.
        This meant combining our individual branches and adding final touches as well. We therefore implemented all the dialouge written with audio that was generated using AI.
        I focused on implementing the last of the animated tiles from last week. As well as implementing the path I designed for the water current puzzle using the forcefields developed last week. 
        The first draft of thr GDD was also finalised during this week. I also created the exposition introduction scene this week. 
        I made the animations in aseprite first then added the generated audio for that dialoguen in iMovie and then played it on a rectangle in unity using a video player and the material override function.
        All existing scenes were also finally put to gether and the torch function was implemented over the whole game.
