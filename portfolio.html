        THS ARMADA is Scandinavia's largest career fair. I was a part of THS
        ARMADA's team of front-end developers in 2022. There I was part of a
        team that developed a web app for the ARMADA competiton.

        We were given the theme "Designing for a World of Introverts" in an
        interactive media course at KTH and chose to design an interactive
        pillow system to allow airplane passangers to regulate the amount of
        interaction they had on the plane. Our group did this by designing both
        a interactive program in each passangers seat monitor and a pillow-like
        headphone system for comfort. We also followed the double diamond
        mthodlogogy throughout the project

        As my bachelor's project I investigated the capabilities of progessive
        web apps in comparison to native apps for comercial flight-booking
        systems. I did this work at the Mobile Life where I tried to emulate the
        functionality of their already existing native app in a progressive web
        app. My thesis is available in
